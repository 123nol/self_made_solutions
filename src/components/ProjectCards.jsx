        <p style={{ fontWeight: "50px", color: "black" }}>
          As part of a new web application development and brand creation, we
          took up the task of developing the initial brand logo of the
          multi-deciplinary property management firm, Nebret Property
          Management. We had a number of detailed analysis on what the Client
          wanted, what the future of the firm is imagined to look like and the
          most rooted use cases the brand appears and the logo follows. Based on
          that we developed a type-heavy logo with a few nicks to showcae the
          firm's market positions and visions.
